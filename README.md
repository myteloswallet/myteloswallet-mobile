## React Native Expo

With Expo tools, services, and React, you can build, deploy, and quickly iterate on native Android, iOS, and web apps from the same JavaScript codebase.

- Access to device capabilities like camera, location, notifications, sensors, haptics, and much more, all with cross-platform APIs.

- Build service gives you app-store ready binaries and handles certificates, no need for you to touch Xcode or Android Studio.

- Over-the-air updates let you update your app at any time without the hassle and delays of submitting to the store.
